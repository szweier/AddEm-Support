  <div class="faq-item">
    <p class="faq-question">What do the difficulty badges mean?</p>

  <div class="faq-item">
    <p class="faq-question">Is my data backed up?</p>
    <p>Your stats and progress are stored locally on your device. If you delete the app, this data will be lost. We
      recommend keeping the app installed to preserve your streak and achievements.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="faq-item">
    <p class="faq-question">Why can't I find a solution?</p>
    <p>Every puzzle is guaranteed to be solvable! If you're stuck, try using a hint or the undo button to try a
      different approach. Sometimes the solution requires selecting groups in a specific order.</p>
