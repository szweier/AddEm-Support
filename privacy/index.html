  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p class="last-updated">Last Updated: December 20, 2025</p>

  <p>This Privacy Policy describes how Add 'Em ("we", "our", or "the app") handles information when you use our mobile
    application.</p>

  <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
  <p><strong>We do not collect any personal information.</strong></p>
  <p>Add 'Em is designed with your privacy in mind. The app:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Does not require an account or login</li>
    <li>Does not collect your name, email, or any personal identifiers</li>
    <li>Does not track your location</li>
    <li>Does not use analytics or tracking services</li>
    <li>Does not contain advertisements</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Data Stored on Your Device</h2>
  <p>Add 'Em stores the following data locally on your device only:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Your puzzle completion history and statistics</li>
    <li>Your current streak information</li>
    <li>App preferences and settings</li>
    <li>Achievement progress</li>
  </ul>
  <p>This data never leaves your device and is not transmitted to any servers.</p>

  <h2>Notifications</h2>
  <p>If you enable daily reminders, notifications are scheduled locally on your device. We do not use push notification
    services that require transmitting data to external servers.</p>

  <h2>Sharing Features</h2>
  <p>When you use the share feature to share your results or challenge friends, the app generates a shareable image and
    text. This sharing is handled entirely by your device's native sharing functionality, and we do not have access to
    or store any information about what you share or with whom.</p>

  <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
  <p>Add 'Em does not collect personal information from anyone, including children under 13. The app is safe for users
    of all ages.</p>

  <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>Add 'Em does not integrate with any third-party analytics, advertising, or tracking services.</p>

  <h2>Data Security</h2>
  <p>Since all data is stored locally on your device and never transmitted, your information is protected by your
    device's built-in security features.</p>

  <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
  <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy
    Policy on this page and updating the "Last Updated" date.</p>

  <h2>Contact Us</h2>
  <p>If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact us at:</p>
  <p>Email: <a href="mailto:modish_advised.9a@icloud.com">modish_advised.9a@icloud.com</a></p>

  <h2>Your Rights</h2>
  <p>Since we don't collect any personal data, there is no personal data to access, modify, or delete. You can clear all
    app data by deleting the app from your device.</p>
